    <p>This document describes an OWL2 ontology [[!owl2-quick-reference]] for the description of a project, aimed at supporting linked data publishing of project descriptions across a number of domains. The ontology extends W3C Prov ontology [[!prov-o]] with typical features of a project description, including sub-activities, specific agent roles, and funding arrangements. It is expected to be specialized for applications that have more detailed requirements.   </p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      This document describes a core ontology for the description of a project, known as PROJECT.
      A <i>project</i> is a formal, planned activity, in which one or more agent participants fill specific roles (e.g. project leader, sponsor or funder), which is typically structured as a set of sub-activities, and generates products.
      The project is a key unit of activity in modern business.
      A project provides context for many productive activities and their outputs, including datasets.
    </p>
    <p>
      A number of previous initiatives have developed project ontologies.
      In Friend of a Friend (FOAF) [[foaf]] the <a href="http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Project">foaf:Project</a> class is a stub (no specific properties) which was included primarily to act as the topic of a homepage.
      The Description of a Project ontology (DOAP) [[doap]] is oriented to software development projects.
      The Funding, Research Administration and Projects Ontology (FRAPO) [[frapo]] is similarly aimed at describing administrative information relating to grant funding and research projects. There are classes for the characterization of <a href="http://purl.org/cerif/frapo/Grant">grant applications</a>, <a href="http://purl.org/cerif/frapo/University">funding bodies</a>, project partners etc, but FRAPO uses the <a href="http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Project">foaf:Project</a> class directly with just one additional property related to identification, not function.
      The Project Documents Ontology (PDO) [[pdo]] relates to  various documents in a project-specific setting, like meeting minutes, status reports etc.
      In VIVO-ISF [[vivo-isf]] the <a href="http://vivoweb.org/ontology/core#Project">vivo:Project</a> class is very lightweight, characterised only by its timing and geographic focus. VIVO is linked to the OBO Foundry [[obo]] and other ontologies there (e.g. the Open-Med <a href="https://open.med.harvard.edu/wiki/display/eaglei/Ontology">eagle-i</a> ontology) provide specializations, but in the context of relatively narrow domain applications.
    </p>
    <p>
      The DBPedia ontology [[dbpedia-ont]] provides what is probably the most general purpose class for projects.
      The <a href="http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Project">dbo:Project</a> class is described as "a temporary endeavor undertaken to achieve defined objectives" and has key properties relating to timing, objectives, and classification (keywords).
      A specialization <a href="http://dbpedia.org/ontology/ResearchProject">dbo:ResearchProject</a> adds information about funding and key stakeholders (coordinator, participant, funder).
    </p>
    <p>
      PPSR-Core ?
    </p>
    <p>
      However, none of the models discussed here supports the variety of relationships with stakeholders, inputs and outputs, and sub-activities that are characteristic of projects.
      Nevertheless, these relations are templated in the W3C PROV-O ontology [[!prov-o]] which provides quite rich, though generic, support for many kinds of links between activities, stakeholders (agents) and artefacts (entities) related to projects.
      Thus, the Project ontology is designed as an extension to PROV-O, with the core proj:Project class specializing <a href="http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#Activity">prov:Activity</a> by adding the key project-related concepts.
    </p>

    <h2>Overview of project ontology</h2>
    <section id="scope" class="informative">
      <h3>Scope of the Project ontology</h3>
      <p>
        The PROJECT ontology is designed to enable publication of information describing projects, including research projects.
        It is not designed to support project management, though sub-activities are included.
        As far as possible PROJECT is intended to be domain-neutral, and it is expected that domains and applications will specialize or extend this ontology for more specific purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ontology gives terms to support the representation of:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          project planning, funding, goals
        </li><li>
          project stakeholders and relationships
        </li><li>
          project activities and timeline
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        One specialization is included - the <i>Research Project</i> - which has been the subject of several predecessor designs that have informed the design of this ontology.
      </p>
      <p>
        PROJECT extends the W3C [[!prov-o]] ontology.
        Otherwise, it has no dependencies except for the normal RDF/OWL infrastructure
        (RDF [[!rdf11-concepts]], RDFS [[!rdf-schema]], OWL [[!owl2-quick-reference]]),
        Dublin Core [[dc-terms]] for some ontology metadata, and SKOS [[!skos-reference]] to support some relationships between Role values, and project classification.
      </p>
      <p>
        A summary of the main classes and relationships in PROJECT is shown in the diagram below, including the key superclass <a href="http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#Activity">prov:Activity</a>.

      <h3>Examples</h3>
      <p>
        We present two examples to illustrate the scope and some of the capabilities of the PROJECT ontology.
      </p>
      <section id="construction-project">
        <h4>Construction project</h4>
        <p>
          This example describes a recent public works project carried out in Melbourne, Australia.
          It concerns a phase of an initiative to replace level-crossings on the suburban rail network.
          It was sponsored by the state government, who were also the sole funders.
          This phase involved the removal of four level crossings.
          The project was led by a consortium.
          Three public transport bodies also participated.
          The project was completed several months early.
        </p>
        <p>
          The level of detail shown here is intended only to illustrate the expressivity of the PROJECT ontology, and the use of structures from an external vocabulary to complement.

        <h4>Research project</h4>
        <p>
          This example is a scientific research project to assess the impact of feral animals on natural and social values in the Archer River Basin of Australia’s Cape York Peninsula.
          The objective is to establish a robust baseline of feral animal distribution and describe the impact of these animals on freshwater ecosystems, biodiversity and cultural values.
          The project has five separate surveys which each apply different methodologies (dwcterms:samplingProtocol) to collect different data sets, each with a different survey schema.
          The project commenced on 31st Dec 2012, but no end date has been specified.
          It was set up under the National Environmental Science Programme, but has not had a funding value attributed to it yet.
          It is being run by CSIRO with a CSIRO officer managing the it and two other organisations associated with it <b>... work needed on org description ...</b>.
          A research paper has been published as an output.

        The core class in the PROJECT ontology is <a href="#proj:Project">proj:Project</a> which is intended to be applicable to a broad range of project types.
        A <i>project</i> is a planned activity that generates outputs, and is modelled as a specialization of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/#Activity">prov:Activity</a> class.
      </p>
      <p>
        A project or activity is typically organized through a set of sub-activities, which may be undertaken concurrently or consecutively, and may themselves be composed of further sub-activities.
        Basic structure is captured through the <a href="#proj:hasSubActivity">proj:hasSubActivity</a> and <a href="#proj:isSubActivityOf">proj:isSubActivityOf</a> properties.
        A project or activity is often related to or influenced by other activities, captured through the <a href="#proj:hasRelatedActivity">proj:hasRelatedActivity</a> property.
        Details of each relationship are captured as properties of the individual <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/#ActivityInfluence">prov:ActivityInfluence</a>, using the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/#hadRrole">prov:hadRole</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/#activity">prov:activity</a> properties, plus other properties as required.

        There are a number of distinctive stakeholders in a project, in particular: a leader who is accountable for the delivery of project outcomes; a sponsor under whose authority the project is undertaken; funders; and project staff or participants.
        In some cases it is useful to provide specific details of a participant's role in the project.
        PROJECT provides a number of ways to represent the relationships of stakeholders to projects and activities.
      </p>
      <p>
        The standard roles of <i>leader</i>, <i>participant</i> are each implemented as a directly named property from an <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/#Activity">prov:Activity</a> to a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/#Agent">prov:Agent</a>, and <i>sponsor</i> as a directly named property from a <a href="#proj:Project">proj:Project</a> to a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/#Agent">prov:Agent</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Basic funding arrangements are captured through the <a href="#proj:hasSponsor">proj:hasSponsor</a> and <a href="#proj:hasBudgetTotal">proj:hasBudgetTotal</a> properties.
        More complex arrangements, for example if multiple funders are involved, can be captured through the <a href="#proj:isFundedThrough">proj:isFundedThrough</a> property, which links a funding agent with a funding amount in the context of a project.
      </p>
      <p>
        Other relationships may be expressed using the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/#qualifiedAssociation">prov:qualifiedAssociation</a> property.
        Details of each relationship are captured as properties of the individual <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/#Association">prov:Association</a>, using the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/#role">prov:role</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/#agent">prov:agent</a> properties, plus other properties as required.
      </p>
      <p>
        We distinguish one sub-class, the <a href="#proj:ResearchProject">proj:ResearchProject</a>, in which the leader(s) is known as a <i>Principal Investigator</i>, and which is classified according to its <i>field of research</i>.
